Heart Disease by age, sex and other correlating factors

Hearth disease is still rampant in the U.S. with many suffering from discomfot and in extreme cases, death. I plan to analyze the data gathered and show the strongest correlations to heart health to show what people should me more aware about when it comes to diet and exercise.

I will be using a csv file with 270 entries. This should be enough and is already low due to the removal of any row that had missing values. This will allow all entries to be relevant and rich in its contribution to the generated graphic that is created at the time.

I am someone who has a family history of heart issues. Both of my father's parents had some heart issue and my father as already experienced an open heart surgery. I would like to find out personally the highest contributing factors for myself and any of those who may be interested. Those like myself have a high genetic risk to heart disease could benefit from the knowledge that can be extracted from this dataset. This dataset also includes if the person has thalassemia, a blood disorder where the amount of hemoglobin in the blood is reduced.

csv file will is included for you to review as well as the data description below.

Age: Patients Age in years (Numeric)
Sex: Gender (Male : 1; Female : 0) (Nominal)
cp: Type of chest pain experienced by patient. This term categorized into 4 category. 0 typical angina, 1 atypical angina, 2 non- anginal pain, 3 asymptomatic (Nominal)
trestbps: patient's level of blood pressure at resting mode in mm/HG (Numerical)
chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl (Numeric)
fbs: Blood sugar levels on fasting > 120 mg/dl represents as 1 in case of true and 0 as false (Nominal)
restecg: Result of electrocardiogram while at rest are represented in 3 distinct values 0 : Normal 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophyby Estes' criteria (Nominal)
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved (Numeric)
exang: Angina induced by exercise 0 depicting NO 1 depicting Yes (Nominal)
oldpeak: Exercise induced ST-depression in relative with the state of rest (Numeric)
slope: ST segment measured in terms of slope during peak exercise 0: up sloping; 1: flat; 2: down sloping(Nominal)
ca: The number of major vessels (0â€“3)(nominal)
thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia
0: NULL 1: normal blood flow 2: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart) 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal(nominal) target: It is the target variable which we have to predict 1 means patient is suffering from heart disease and 0 means patient is normal.
