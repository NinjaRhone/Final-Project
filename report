Final Report by Zoe Beason

Using the graph created with the given site. I was able to pick out a few findings.

First I found that patients that experienced chest pains rating 2 or 3 happened mostly within the ages of 40 to about 67. There was an even mix of male and female in this area. Most females reported having at least a level of 1 on chest pain with only a few reporting 0 for chest pain.

Second when looking at readings for cholesterol, there was a trend that men tested no higher that approximately 360 mg/dL. But there where a few women well above this area around 400 mg/dL with one female at over 550 mg/dL, which will be treated as an outlier for this case.

Another interesting find is that all women either had normal blood flow or a reversible defect when tested for thalassemia.

In future data research I think it would be beneficial to have an even number of male to female patient data. This helps to spot correlations in health data that pertain to sex. Though the data can be used in this chart to identify male trends easier.

In conclusion, It seems men have better cholesterol levels than women. Online sources point to how human hormones effect how we handle our cholesterol differently as men and women.
